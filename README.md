# Traffic Signs Recognition


# Abstract
In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companiesare working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.

Therefore, in this project we aim to build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.

# Problem statement
Given a various traffic signs along with images dataset , we are challenged to classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.

# Data

- For this project, we are using the public dataset available at Kaggle: [Traffic Signs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shanmukh05/traffic-sign-cropped)

- The dataset contains around 50,000 images of different traffic signs. 
It is further classified into 43 different classes.
- The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. 
- The size of the dataset is 44 MB.
- The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.
